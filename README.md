## Workflow and General tips

- Create a branch for feature/fix, write and test code (use `npm run dev` to test locally) on that specific branch.
- Create a PR for that branch into `master` (assuming more than one person is working on this repo, else go ahead and directly push to master).
- If PR is approved, and once code is merged/pushed into master, run `npm run deploy` to deploy the build to the gh-pages branch.
- Thats's it!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm predeploy`

Builds the project for it to be deployes.

### `npm deploy`

Deploys build to gh-pages branch of the repository.
Open [https://trevordsouza.com/](https://trevordsouza.com/) to view it live.

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
